# 🧠 AI Research Paper Assistant

An intelligent assistant that fetches **recent arXiv papers**, stores them as **semantic vectors**, and answers your queries using **OpenRouter-powered LLMs** — enhanced with a **feedback loop** for long-term memory and learning.

---

## 🚀 What This Project Does

🔹 Fetches the latest arXiv papers based on any research topic  
🔹 Stores paper summaries in a **vector database (ChromaDB)**  
🔹 Lets you ask custom questions on those papers  
🔹 Generates answers using **LLMs via OpenRouter**  
🔹 Learns from your feedback — stores useful Q&A for future queries

## 🔄 How It Works (System Flow)

### Step 1: Topic Input  
You provide a research topic like:


### Step 2: Real-time Paper Fetching  
- The app fetches 5–10 recent papers via the **arXiv API**  
- Metadata + summaries are saved in JSON

### Step 3: Vector Storage  
- All summaries are embedded (using OpenRouter embedding model)
- Stored in **ChromaDB** for semantic search

### Step 4: Ask a Question  
You can now ask any question like:


- The app:
  - Retrieves top `k` relevant summaries from ChromaDB
  - Fuses them into a context block
  - Sends the context + question to OpenRouter LLM (like `mistralai/mistral-8b`)

### Step 5: Feedback Loop  
If you like the answer:
- The app logs the **Q&A pair into ChromaDB**
- These become part of memory for future question answering
